## Welcome to My Work Portfolio

Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub Work Portfolio. My name is Emily Pfeffer.

### About Me
I'm a recent Gator Grad who loves pretty much every aspect of business systems analysis, programming, and implementation. My hobbies include tae kwon do, kayaking, and going to the occassional baseball game. So you can put a face to the name, here's a picture of me with my main squeeze, Albert Gator. :smirk:
